# Hi

My name is 李成蹊, you can call me Chauncey or رشيد, chose one you can recognize!

I’m a M.A. student in Peking Univ. (hoping to update the title & school soon).
My M.A. thesis focuses on negation processing in,
My interests also 
Besides, I’m broadly interested in %%representational and behavioral analyses of both humans and language models (large or not)%% (can't wait to develop them into my profession soon).

I completed my BA in Arabic from Sun Yat-Sen Univ. in Guangzhou & Zhuhai, where I found my second hometowns.

My time between research and sleep are occupied by: brewing coffee (or exploring recipes) in [Sketch Coffee](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HQSi136mdxuTajCfferEug), [shooting/teaching archery](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BZXqIMj334kLJDsINFCEyg), or cycling (while commuting & taking [photos](https://unsplash.com/@chaunceyli)).
