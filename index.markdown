# Hi 👋


My name is 李成蹊, Chauncey and رشيد, whichever you recognize!

I’m currently an M.A. student at Peking Univ. 
<span style="color: #BEBEBE;">(hoping to update the title and institution by 2025 Fall)</span>.
My M.A. project focuses on negation processing in yes/no questions of Chinese and English 
<span style="color: #BEBEBE;">(two languages with different answering systems)</span>.
I’m also interested in ambiguity resolution, the cognitive aspects of language acquisition, and the role of context in these processes and representations 
<span style="color: #BEBEBE;">(can't wait to weave them into my research soon)</span>.

I completed my B.A. in Arabic Language and Literature from Sun Yat-Sen Univ. in Guangzhou & Zhuhai, where I found my second hometowns.

My time between research and sleep are occupied by: 

- brewing coffee (or exploring recipes) in [Sketch Coffee](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HQSi136mdxuTajCfferEug)
- [shooting/teaching archery](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BZXqIMj334kLJDsINFCEyg), or
- cycling (while commuting & taking [photos](https://unsplash.com/@chaunceyli))
