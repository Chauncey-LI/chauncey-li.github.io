Iâ€™m currently an M.A. student at Peking University.
my M.A. project focuses on negation processing in yes/no questions of Chinese and English, two languages with different answering systems.

I am also interested in exploring the following topics from a cognitive perspective:

- how we reason about the intended meaning of speech
- the role of pragmatic cues (e.g., context) in this reasoning
- language acquisition (L1 & Ln, children & adults)
- bilingualism

These topics are excerpts from the [draft of my statement of purpose](/files/SOP_chengxi.pdf), and I hope to weave them into my future research.

I completed my B.A. in Arabic Language and Literature from Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou & Zhuhai, where I found my second hometown(s).

When not doing research or sleeping, I:

- brew coffee (or explore recipes) in [Sketch Coffee](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HQSi136mdxuTajCfferEug),
- [practice & teach archery](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BZXqIMj334kLJDsINFCEyg), and
- go cycling (for commuting & taking [photos](https://unsplash.com/@chaunceyli))
