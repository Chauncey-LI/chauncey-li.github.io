I’m currently an M.A. student at Peking Univ,
my M.A. project focuses on negation processing in yes/no questions of Chinese and English, two languages with different answering systems.
I’m also interested in

- how we reason about the intended meaning of a speech,
- the cognitive aspect of language acquisition, and
- the role of pragmatic cues in langauge processing and its representations, e.g. context

I completed my B.A. in Arabic Language and Literature from Sun Yat-Sen Univ. in Guangzhou & Zhuhai, where I found my second hometown.

My time between research and sleep are occupied by

- brewing coffee (or exploring recipes) in [Sketch Coffee](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/HQSi136mdxuTajCfferEug),
- [shooting/teaching archery](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/BZXqIMj334kLJDsINFCEyg), or
- cycling (while commuting & taking [photos](https://unsplash.com/@chaunceyli))
